A psychofunctional toolbox that can be used in screening visuospatial neglect. 

See the documentation/manual at documanual_version_0.pdf

Creating a standalone .exe can be done using (a modified version of) command_stable.txt. This is a PyInstaller command. PyInstaller should be installed to your python version for this to work.
